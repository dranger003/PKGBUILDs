In consideration for Freescale allowing Licensee to access the Software, Licensee is agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee does not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, Licensee must not download the Software.  If Licensee does not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement after downloading the Software, Licensee must stop using the Software and delete all copies of the Software in its possession or control.

Licensee must prohibit its sublicensees from translating, reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling the Software except to the extent applicable law specifically prohibits such restriction. If Licensee violates any of the terms or restrictions of this Agreement, Freescale may immediately terminate this Agreement, and require that Licensee stop using and delete all copies of the Software in its possession or control.

SEVERABILITY.
